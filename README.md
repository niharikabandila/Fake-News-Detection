# Fake-News-Detection
This project mainly describes about how to detect the fake news using machine learning algorithms. Fake news's simple meaning is to incorporate information that leads people to the wrong path. Nowadays fake news spreading like water and the people are sharing this information without verifying it.So, this project helps the people to detect the fake news.This uses machine learning algorithm "PassiveAggressiveClassifier" model which is commonly used for binary classification problems.The output of "PassiveAggressiveClassifier" model is a probability score that predicts the likelihood of the binary outcome for each data point.

## Tools
- [ ] Python 3.6 or higher versioned IDLE   or
- [ ] VsCode Editor         or
- [ ] Anaconda  - Jupyter   or
- [ ] Anaconda  - Spyder    or

## Modules
- [ ] Pandas
- [ ] Sklearn

## Dataset
The project uses a custom dataset collected from various sources . The dataset contains a total of *7000+* data which involves title,author, text and label. The data has been pre-processed and augmented to improve the model's performance. 

## Model
The model is trained on PassiveAggressiveClassifier model and the required data is extracted by using NLTK Module from the dataset of real and fake news articles, and then tested on a separate dataset which was created to measure its accuracy.
